# PANDAS-DATA_CLEANING
This project uses Python Pandas to clean and prepare raw data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, standardizing text, and detecting outliers. The cleaned dataset becomes accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis or further machine-learning tasks.
